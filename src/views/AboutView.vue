    <p>The Krusty Krab is a restaurant in the city of Bikini Bottom in the animated television comedy SpongeBob SquarePants. It is owned by Eugene H. Krabs. The restaurant's name is a parody of the restaurant called the Krusty Burger (owned by Krusty the Clown) from the 1989 TV Series The Simpsons.

The Krusty Krab usually has two employees: SpongeBob, the restaurant's fry cook, and Squidward, the restaurant's cashier. Both employees have difficulties with working together: Squidward hates SpongeBob, and SpongeBob in turn exacerbates the situation by remaining completely naive toward Squidward's spiteful attitude. The restaurant's menu consists of the usual fast-food products, with its specialty being Krabby Patties, similar to hamburgers in appearance. Plankton, the owner of the Krusty Krab's rival restaurant, The Chum Bucket is always trying to find out the mystery ingredients of the Krabby Patty. Somehow, the Krabby Patty secret formula will never be revealed, but only to SpongeBob and Mr. Krabs.</p>
